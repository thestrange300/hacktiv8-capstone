## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Development Process

This project is a testament to what can be achieved with foundational web technologies, augmented by modern AI.

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
    *   **CSS3:** For advanced styling, including custom properties (variables), Flexbox, Grid, and responsive design.
    *   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** For all application logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.

*   **AI-Assisted Development:**
    *   **IBM Granite Model:** This powerful model was utilized for code generation and optimization tasks throughout the development process. It helped in scaffolding components, writing utility functions, and refining the overall codebase for better performance and readability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Running this application is incredibly simple.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the file):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thestrange300/hacktiv8-capstone
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd hacktiv8-capstone
    ```
3.  **Open the HTML file:**
    Simply open the `modern_task_manager.html` file in your favorite web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it! The application is now running locally in your browser.

> **Note:** Since the application uses in-memory storage (a JavaScript array) and not `localStorage`, your tasks will be reset every time you refresh the page. This was a design choice to keep the project self-contained and simple.

## üéì Project Context

This application was created as the final capstone project for the **Hacktiv8 Code Generations and Optimization IBM Skills Development Initiative (SDI) Class**. The primary goal was to build a functional, well-designed web application while leveraging the **IBM Granite model** to explore the capabilities of AI in modern software development. The model assisted in generating robust, boilerplate-free code and optimizing logic, demonstrating a practical application of AI in a real-world project.
